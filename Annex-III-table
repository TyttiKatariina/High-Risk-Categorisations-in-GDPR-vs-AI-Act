    <h2>GDPR DPIA's and High-Risk AI systems EU AI Act Annex III</h2>
    
    <p>Below you will find an interactive table that shows how personal data is involved in the high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III of the EU AI Act. By <b>DOUBLE clicking</b> on the first colomn ex. "1a. Biometrics" an explanation will appear that describes what data we found to require a DPIA either according to GDPR or according to individual member state data protection authorities.</p>
     <p>This table was created by looking at information within the 25 high-risk descriptions (8 clauses and their subclauses) listed in Annex III, and assessed whether they involved personal data explicitly (i.e. it can be reasonably inferred from the description) or conditionally (i.e. it may be potentially involved in a particular application) to assess the applicability of GDPR to Annex III clauses. Similarly, for each of the key concepts we identified whether they are explicitly or conditionally applicable in each of the Annex III clauses. If a conditional applicability was identified, we added an identifier to distinguish the conditional clause from the main or explicit clause present in Annex III. Finally, we identified if the combination of the key concepts matched any of the DPIA required conditions identified from the analysis in Section 3. In this, we distinguished whether each condition came from the GDPR (i.e. GDPR Art.35 or EDPB) or a specific member state list - through which we determined whether the applicability of a DPIA required condition was uniform across the EU (i.e. it came from GDPR) or there was a variance (i.e. it is only present in one or more countries).</p>
    <p>From this exercise, we found personal data was explicitly involved and hence GDPR is applicable in 23 out of the 25 Annex III clauses as seen in the following table. The only ones where GDPR is not always applicable are Annex III clause 2a and clause 8a, though GDPR may be conditionally applicable based on the involvement of personal data in a particular use-case. To distinguish such conditional applicabilities, we created additional identifiers to distinguish between each variation, for example in Annex III-2a related to critical infrastructure we identified 3 variations based on involvement of: III-2a.1 smart meters, III-2a.2 road traffic video analysis, and III-2a.3 public transport monitoring systems. Each such variation involves the conditional applicability of a concept (technology for III-2a) and allows us to match the Annex III clause to a DPIA required condition, e.g. smart meters in III-2a.1 match with DPIA required conditions from Hun gary, Poland, and Romania. We found 36 such additional use cases based on the conditional applicability of key concepts in DPIA required conditions. In sum there are 61 total (sub)clauses and use cases for which a DPIA is always required for 21 use cases, is conditionally required for 38 and is not required for 2, as seen below.</p>
